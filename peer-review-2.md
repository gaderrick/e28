*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*

### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
1. Two css files threw 404 errors: fullcalendar.min.css and fullcalendar.print.css (in the console)
2. Adding a new show redirected me to a calendar for the month, but there was no indication of why, and the calendar did not display the show I entered.

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
There was not much in the way of instruction on how to use the site (aside from the create a new show). Maybe breaking the site into different sections for admin and user would help. There is a favorites section, but it doesn't really indicate what to do or how to load items into it.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
He used regex in a function, but doesn't really explain what it is for. A single line comment would be good.

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?


### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
The author used a different naming conven for folders than we went over. Not wrong, just different.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
Very well laid out website. The CSS used works well for the site. Nice job implementing the error checking in P3. Excellent use of terniary operators to keep code compact. Several advanced programming techniques were implemented to improve the codebase.
