    <p>Welcome to the high/low guessing game. Guess a number between 1 and 100 to find the mystery number.
        Pick too high
        or low, and I'll give you a hint to refine your guess. Pick the number in less than <span
            id="spanMaxGuesses"></span> guesses and you win!</p>
    <p></p>
    Pick a number:<br>
    <form id="formGuesses">
        <input type="text" id="txtUserGuess">
        <input type="button" value="Guess" onclick="gamePlay()">
    </form>
    <p></p>
    <p>
